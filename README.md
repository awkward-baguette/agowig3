Hello, this is Ritu.
This project is for my mother's website. As you can see if you read the About the Founder page, my mother runs a startup for handloom fabrics. Please check it out if you want!
This website is still a work in progress, and we still have to acquire an address for it. 
As you can see, team, fabrics and gallery don't really have anything other than the founder's photo. This is just because my mother hasn't sent me the information for those pages yet. 
The instagram link is real though! Do check out the company page if you have the time.
