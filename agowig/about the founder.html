		 Agowig is headed by Nanditha Sulur, a textile engineer and textile designer who is passionate about fabric structures, materials, techniques, and processes. Her journey has been towards creating new-age job opportunities for handweavers which will keep them in the profession while making fabrics that do not drain the earth of its resources and prevent landfills.
		 <br>
		 A research and development project in the recycled handwoven space was what introduced her to the Gottigere weaver’s colony and the weavers there. Agowig was born as an attempt to organise the local handweavers into a collective force. A small team of young women weavers who are passionate about continuing weaving as a profession are our backbone. They are supported and guided by Nanditha’s technical and design experience.
